# Vault PKI lab
## Starting the Vault Server

A config file must be provided when starting the Vault server.

The file `config.hcl` specifies that :
- Vault data is located in `./vault/data`
- Vault will listen for HTTP requests at `127.0.0.1:8200`

If it does not exist, create the vault data directory :
```shell
mkdir -p ./vault/data
```

Then start the server :
```shell
vault server -confg=config.hcl
```

## Set up the client
The `vault` command is also used to act as a client.

The Vault client uses the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable to know the server address.

In the terminal that will be used to act as client, export the environment variable :
```shell
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```
## Initialize the Vault
### Initialize
We request the unseal key to be split into 6 shards, of which 2 are required to unseal the Vault.
```shell
vault operator init -key-shares=6 -key-threshold=2
```
The following information is printed in the terminal :
- The 6 key shards
- A root token, that allows to authenticate as root in the vault and have full control of it. We will use it to do the first configurations.

### Unseal the Vault

Two different key shards must be provided to Vault.

To provide a key shard we run :
```shell
vault operator unseal
```
and then we enter the key shard.

The two key shards can be provided from different terminals.

### Authenticate as root

We authenticate as root by running :
```shell
vault login
```
and then entering the root token.

## Switch to an admin policy
### Create the admin policy

To write a policy into Vault, we must provide a file that describes it.

The policy we add is described in `admin-policy.hcl`.

This file contains the admin policy provided in the [Vault policies tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/policies?in=vault/policies) plus some additional capabilities as described in the [Vault pki tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/pki-engine). 

To create the admin policy we run:
```shell
vault policy write admin admin-policy.hcl
```
### Switch token
We create a token associated with the new admin policy :
```shell
vault token create -orphan -policy=admin
```
Without the `-orphan` flag the root token would be the parent of the admin token i.e. revoking the root token would revoke the admin token.
This flag allows the admin token to stay valid after the revocation of the root token.

We revoke the root token :
```shell
vault token revoke <root token>
```
According to [the documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens), root tokens should be revoked immediately after they are no longer needed.
If a new root token is needed in the feature, it can be generated by a quorum of unseal key holders.

We log in again but this time using the admin token :
```shell
vault login
```
and we provide the admin token.
## PKI
### Root certificate
We generate the root certificate :
```shell
vault secrets enable pki
vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=87600h pki
vault write -field=certificate pki/root/generate/internal common_name="heig-vd.ch" issuer_name="root-2022" ttl=87600h > root_2022_ca.crt
```
This :
* Creates a PKI engine at the location `pki`
* Sets the maximal certificate TTL for this PKI engine to 10 years
* Creates a root certificate with a TTL of 10 years and the common name `heig-vd.ch`
* Writes the certificate to the file `root_2022_ca.crt`

We configure the URLs for this PKI engine :
```shell
vault write pki/config/urls issuing_certificates="$VAULT_ADDR/v1/pki/ca" crl_distribution_points="$VAULT_ADDR/v1/pki/crl"
```
Those URLs will be included in the certificates signed by the root certificate.
They indicate [where to find information about the root certificate](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1) and [where to find the CRL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.13).
### Intermediate certificate
We create a PKI engine for the intermediate certificate at the location `pki_int` and with a maximal TTL of 5 years :
```shell
vault secrets enable -path=pki_int pki
vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=43800h pki_int
```
We generate a CSR for the intermediate certificate that is stored in the file `pki_intermediate.csr`:
```shell
vault write -format=json pki_int/intermediate/generate/internal \
     common_name="heig-vd.ch Intermediate Authority" \
     issuer_name="heig-vd-ch-intermediate" \
     | jq -r '.data.csr' > pki_intermediate.csr
```
We sign the intermediate certificate with the root certificate and save it in the file `intermediate.cert.pem`:
```shell
vault write -format=json pki/root/sign-intermediate \
     issuer_ref="root-2022" \
     csr=@pki_intermediate.csr \
     format=pem_bundle ttl="43800h" \
     | jq -r '.data.certificate' > intermediate.cert.pem
```
We import the signed intermediate certificate in the `pki_int` PKI engine :
```shell
vault write pki_int/intermediate/set-signed certificate=@intermediate.cert.pem
```
### Role
A role corresponds to a PKI engine sub path from where a user can request new certificates signed by the certificate of the PKI engine.
We can define constraints about the certificates a user can get from a specific role.

We create a role that will be available at `pki_int/issue/intra-heig-vd-ch` for obtaining certificates signed by the intermediate certificate :
```shell
vault write pki_int/roles/intra-heig-vd-ch \
     issuer_ref="$(vault read -field=default pki_int/config/issuers)" \
     allowed_domains="intra.heig-vd.ch" \
     allow_bare_domains=true \
     allow_subdomains=false \
     max_ttl="720h"
```
This role only allows to get certificates for the exact domain `intra.heig-vd.ch`
### Intra policy
We want to create a policy that only allows to get certificates from the role `pki_int/issue/intra-heig-vd-ch`.
To configure it, we need to know exactly which capability is needed to get the certificate.

We cat get this information using the `-output-policy` flag combined with the command we want to execute. We run :
```shell
vault write -output-policy pki_int/issue/intra-heig-vd-ch common_name="intra.heig-vd.ch" ttl="24h"
```
and the output is
```
`path "pki_int/issue/intra-heig-vd-ch" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}`
```
We create a policy description file `intra-policy.hcl` with the exact above content.

We create a new policy based on this file :
```shell
vault policy write intra intra-policy.hcl
```
## Users
### Create users
We create a user `toto` with the policy `intra` :
```shell
vault write auth/userpass/users/toto password=titi policies=intra
```
We create a user `admin` with the policy `admin` :
```shell
vault write auth/userpass/users/admin password=admin policies=admin
```
It is now possible to log in using
```shell
vault login -method=userpass username=<username>
```
### Test intra user
We log in as the user `intra` :
```shell
vault login -method=userpass username=intra
```
And we try to execute some admin commands.

## Questions
#### 4.1. What is the goal of the unseal process? Why are they more than one unsealing key?
The data stored by Vault is encrypted. The goal of the unseal process is to provide to Vault the key to decrypt the data.

The key needed by Vault is split into shards (6 in this lab), of which a minimum threshold (2 in this lab) is required to recover the root key.

Each key must be given to a different person. Having a minimum threshold of required keys increases security, as an attacker would have to obtain multiple keys from multiple persons to access the vault.
Having a total number of keys greater than the threshold protects against loosing access to the Vault if a key becomes inaccessible.

#### 4.2. What is a security officer ? What do you do if one leaves the company?

Security officers are the trusted persons that will each receive a key shard.

It is not possible to revoke only one key shard. If a security officer leaves the company, the key shards must be replaced by new ones and distributed to the remaining security officers.
This operation is called rekeying.

#### 6.1. Why is it recommended to store the root certificate private key outside of Vault (we did not do this here)?

The entire PKI infrastructure security depends on the confidentiality of the root certificate private key. If an attacker obtains the root certificate private key, he can generate and sign certificates that will be trusted by the users of the PKI.

If the root certificate private key is compromised, a new root certificate must be created and distributed to all devices that use the PKI, which is a complicated and costly process.

Even though there are mechanisms that protect the confidentiality of the data stored in Vault, there is always a risk that an attacker can get access to this data.
Vault is a software exposed to the internet, and there could be a vulnerability that allows an attacker to extract data from it.

The root certificate private key is rarely used, it is necessary only to sign intermediate certificates, which is probably done only once every few years. Therefore, the inconvenience of storing the root certificate private key outside of Vault is low.

#### 6.2. Where would you typically store the root certificate private key?

I would store it in an HSM. The HSM should be able to use the private key to sign intermediate certificates, but should never disclose the private key.

The private key would itself be encrypted with an encryption key, such that the HSM needs to obtain the encryption key to use the private key. The encryption key would be split into several shards.

The HSM and the encryption key shards would be distributed to different persons and stored in separated secured locations, such as safes.

#### 6.3. How would you implement this?
Generate the root certificate key pair :

During a key ceremony, the root certificate key pair is generated inside an HSM. The public key is disclosed by the HSM. The private key is encrypted inside the HSM with an encryption key. This encryption key is split into shards and each shard is stored on a different smartcard.

Use the private key to sign an intermediate certificate :

A CSR for the intermediate certificate is generated with Vault. During a key ceremony, the HSM and the smartcards are connected together. The HSM uses the key shards stored on the smartcards to decrypt the root certificate private key.
The HSM then signs the intermediate certificate according to the CSR. The signed intermediate certificate is stored in Vault.
